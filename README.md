# csvql: a SQL server for CSV files

This is a quick demo I put together to show how easy it is to develop
SQL servers thanks to [gopkg.in/src-d/go-mysql-server.v0](https://gopkg.in/src-d/go-mysql-server.v0).

# Disclaimer

This is a quick demo and is not intended to be used in production, pretty please.
